## Overview
This assignment was to implement a timed counter and modify a testbench by adding additional cases.

## Deliverables
![Terminal output from Testbench.](assets/waveform_transcript.png)
Pictured above is the transcript window output and waveform from the simulation passing the testbench cases for the first three cases - I forgot to add the last ones. oops.

Pictured above is the transcript window output and waveform from the simulation for all 6 testbench cases, where the last three cases test 200 ns.
